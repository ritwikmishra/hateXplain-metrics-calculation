# For hateXplain-training.py




## Python environment & Dependencies
* create a python environment using requirement.txt file with python version-3.8 


## data folder
This 'data' folder should contain following files:
* dataset.json
* hateXplain.json
* train_split1.json, test_split1.json, val_split1.json (for hatespeech model training on split1 data)
* train_split2.json, test_split2.json, val_split2.json (for hatespeech model training on split2 data)
* train_split3.json, test_split3.json, val_split3.json (for hatespeech model training on split3 data)
* test_split1.jsonl, test_split2.jsonl, test_split3.jsonl (these .jsonl file will be used during hateXplain metrics calculation)
* post_id_divisions.json, post_id_division_split1_seed_1234,  post_id_division_split2_seed_12345

## utility files
Following two files should be in the same folder in which ajeet_calculate_metrics.py file is.
* classes.npy
* classes_two.npy
